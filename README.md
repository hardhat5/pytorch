# pytorch
## Implementation of a few deep learning programs in PyTorch
### 1. Linear regression
Sort of a hello world to PyTorch
### 2. XOR gate
Training a network to mimic a XOR gate
### 3. MNIST CNN
Training and testing on MNIST dataset
### 4. Transfer Learning
Using a pre-trained network for image recognition
### 5. Neural Transfer
Simple implementation of the neural transfer paper
### 6. Autoencoder
Learning and reproducing images from the MNIST dataset
